# Overview

![noot noot](https://cdn.overseer.tech/file/the-void/screenshots/WindowsTerminal_dT4Vy4Tjjp.png)

ascii-player is a program that renders an existing video file into an ASCII frame-by-frame representation.

NOTE: The quality of the returned ASCII playback is determined by your terminal size.

- On Windows, the zoom of the terminal affects this, for a higher quality playback you may zoom further out, but this will **greatly increase how long it takes to render**.
